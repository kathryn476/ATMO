        <p>Italian coffee , French Bakery and continental cuisine 
            <h4>Italian coffee </h4>
            <p> For years, ever since the espresso machine was invented, Italy has been considered the modern bastion of fine coffee. Italian coffee is known around the world as the greatest drink and people dream of traveling to Italy, just for the taste of the excellent coffee beverages. We established atmosphere, with the aim of bringing real Italian espresso to Africa. In Italy, espresso bars are the customary meeting place for coffee lovers, local business people and nearby residents. At Atmosphere , just as in Italy, the quality and the fine taste of the coffee as well the way it is prepared and served is always crucial to our concept.
            To satisfy our passion for the best possible coffee , we decided to follow the coffee bean from its source; that is from the plantation and through our unique blending and the roasting process. we keep an “in house” coffee roasting machine concept to ensure that the coffee is at the peak of its freshness, flavor and aroma until the final preparation of a cup of classic Italian coffee. </p> 
           <h4> French bakery </h4>
           <p> We had a very clear vision and goal when we established the Atmosphere Bakery and that is without a fraction of doubt to bring you the very best there is. To do that, we mastered the art of baking from the top bakers of the world
             French “patisserie-boulangerie” which exactly replicates the way the classic French breads and pastries we all adore, are baked.We offer  our customers only the very best from around the world.
